tldr to get running

1. git clone https://github.com/compplus/StepCounterApp.git
2. npm install
3. react-native upgrade
*Important! Make sure you say `y` when asked whether to replace the ios files, in order to avoid the CFBundleIdentifier error. Sometimes, you may have to run this command twice lol*
4. react-native link
5. react-native unlink @asserdata/react-native-universal-pedometer
*Important! Without this, all the react-native links won't work. If you are already running the Metro Bundler, close it before linking or unlinking*
8. react-native run-ios
